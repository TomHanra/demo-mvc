# demo-mvc
Demonstration code for clients that ask if I know about MVC

This is a project using the PHP MVC Framework Laravel, which is itself based on Symfony. To run it as a local webserver run the following command in the project's demo-mvc directory:

php artisan serve

The project doesn't really do much, it uses a local sqlite database to store a trivial model.
